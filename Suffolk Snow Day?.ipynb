    "# Suffolk Snow Day?\n",
    "\n",
    "I was asked to [talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kknr2pmhomVRHV1-6bJG2pGfJytQqGJ3o8FL_yGqp9s/edit?usp=sharing) to a group of law students and to put together a hands-on activity to give them a feel for what I do as a data scientist. So I came up with this grossly simplified workflow for answering that age-old question, \"Can we predict if the law school will call a snow day?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How? That's simple, **statistics**, or as many like to call it these days, AI/machine learning. So let's get going.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Some Stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this code, [download, install, and run Notebooks](https://github.com/colarusso/measured_justice#download-install-and-run-notebooks). After that, [download](https://github.com/colarusso/regression_demo/archive/master.zip) and unzip this project. FYI, you'll have to load a few modules. So you may want to check out these [notes](https://github.com/colarusso/measured_justice#common-speed-bumps) on common speed bumps. Anyhow, the following code loads the tools we need."

    "\n",
    "I wanted at least 5 years of data, and I was at a loss until I noticed that the Suffolk University Twitter account had been around for that long. So I did a little search for [@Suffolk_U tweets containg the word \"closed.\"](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=closed%20from%3ASuffolk_U) From here I constructed a list of closure, and place them into a spreadsheet with the following columns: `date`, `closed`, and `note`. \n",

    "\n",
    "So we need a historic record of Boston's weather. Luckily, there are a lot of places to find this information. I'm going to use the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/account). An API is an interface that allows a computer program to get structured data on-demand. For example, a program visiting `https://api.darksky.net/forecast/[API_KEY]/42.3605,-71.0596,1314849600` will get a [structured reply](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/time-machine) that it can parse for info. \n",
